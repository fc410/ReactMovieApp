# Description
For this app I will utilizing the MovieDB API to create my own movie app where I will display the current top movie with a description on the movie on the home page followed with a search bar so the user can search for any movie in the MovieDB website followed by the next top 20 movies pages if the would like to see more movies. If the user clicks on any movie they will get redirected to the movie webpage where I would display more information about the movie like the revenue, raiting, movie directors and actors. If the user clicks on one of the directors or actors they will get redirected to the actor webpage where I would display more information about that actor or director such as movies they are most know in, and movies or shows they were involved in. All created with React.js for to get more practice with React and API calls.
